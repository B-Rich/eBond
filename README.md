eBond
=====

The eBond network simulator for energy efficient bonding

Example invocation using the profiles found in the extra ebond-profiles package
(assuming this package is checked out at the above directory level)


./sim.py -c profiles/eBond_aggressive.cfg  -b ../ebond-profiles/traffic-profiles/ubuntu_mirror.csv

You may need to fix the paths in profiles/eBond_*.cfg if you have another
directory structure.
